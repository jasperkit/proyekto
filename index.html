          <p class="about-text">
            The oldest civilized art of the Americas came
            from the extraordinary "medieval" culture in Mexico,
            Central America, and Peru—a civilization clearly
            autochthonous despite its similarity in temper to 
            some aspects of Egyptian civilization. For it too
            built unbelievably precise pyramids in stone, and 
            was devoted to hierarchic as well as hieratic social 
            forms. By the time it was wiped out by a handful
            of Spanish musketeers in the 16th century, it had
            developed a civilization far in advance—in subtlety
            and extent of political and economic organization
            —of its European destroyer.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="about-text">
            The art belonging to this civilization is usually
            distinguished by the term Pre-Columbian, and
            shows a rich symbolic character and immense plas-
            tic vigor, especially in its compact stone sculpture
            which has provoked great interest among both
            laymen and artists of 20th century Europe and
            America.

               Modern Mexican art is another
              class of phenomenon. Choosing mosaic and fresco
              painting, and oil painting often on a large scale,
              its style shows a mixture of the Pre-Columbian
              with Spanish (especially in the death image) and
              native Mexican, as well as advanced abstract and
              above all expressionist art of 20th century Europe.
              Either this is too diffuse a background, with no 
              one leading element, or this is not the time and
              place for the appearance of a significant painting
              style.
            </p>
            <br>
             <p class="education-duration ">
              Despite the noteworthy talent of such painters as 
              jose orozco (the best), diego rivera, david siqueiros, 
              or rufino tamayo the results are seldom entirely
              convincing as art. The theme is too programmatic,
              the style not sufficiently resolved in its own terms.
              Political or social commitment should not neces-
              sarily interfere with art, indeed it may well spur
              it (viz. Goya, David, Gericault, Picasso). But the
              result with 20th century Mexican painting—for 
              whatever reason—is a painting style that appears
              too often muddled, blatant, confused, or even super-
              ficial when compared with German Expressionism
              of the early part of the century, which it emulates,
              or with North American Abstract Expressionism of
              the middle part of the century, which at its best
              attains a pure, strong, rich and creative style, not 
              borrowed or conjured, but original and necessary. 
              (The "primitive" revival of Aztec forms, by way of 
              example, appears self-conscious, apart from the fact 
              that there was nothing primitive about the great age
              of Aztec art.) North American

              North American Art. American Art, as the term
              is generally employed, refers to the produce of the
              North American civilization established by Eu-
              ropeans in the 17th century. To a great extent it
              derives from European art traditions, to some ex-
              tent it is surprisingly indigenous.

            <br>
            <p class="education-duration ">
              For example, the pictures by anonymous "lim-
              ners" Of colonial times were for the most part
              untutored by European styles, and show a wonder-
              ful primitive strength and inventiveness. They also
              show an incisive ability to penetrate personality and
              social role. This helps to distinguish them from
              much that we usually call primitive art. Though
              tending to be flat and linear, they are not without
              spatial grasp or sensitivity to the environment,
              which itself is quite keenly characterized. Perhaps
              most strikin« in such works is the forceful arbitrary
              shaping and distribution of deceptively simple
              elements, setting up a design ingenious in the use
              of repetitions and alternatives, and ingenuously
              expressive in a stiff and vital delineation of character
              or activity.

              Copley (1738-1815). With JOHN SNGLETON COPLEY
              America produced her first painter of international
              importance. Copley's style and subjects are Ameri-
              can, but he was familiar with certain kinds of
              European painting (the portrait vivacity of Van
              Dyck, the architectural sobriety of Poussin). The
              result in Copley's best work is an impeccably clear
              and rigorous design, but by now subtle and ar-
              ticulate as contrasted with much of the work of
              the limners. By the same token his characteriza-
              tions (Plate 60a) carry fine overtones of complex
              expression and self-awareness on the part of the
              sitter, and are for a provincial colony highly civ-
              ilized works. Yet in retaining such extraordinary
              directness in presentation and forthrightness in
              attitude, they mark themselves as belonging to an
              uncompromising frontier and a new brand of society.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="education-duration ">
              With fame, Copley was enticed to Europe
              where the effete, diffused and melodramatic tend-
              encies of the late Baroque contemporary British
              style of portrait painting overcame his native sense
              and then his strength, and his work was ruined.
              This was the beginning of a long, and to Americans
              devastating, trail Of native talent whose art was
              damaged, wrecked or dissipated by return to the
              old country. Americans have never been guaranteed
              success by remaining in Kansas; only have they been
              more or less assured of emasculation by too long a
              stay in Europe.

                Stuart (1792-1866). Compared with the sterling
                veracity and command of Copley's best work, the
                distinguished paintings of GILBERT STUART appear
                sophisticated and mannered, although the capture
                of personality and character is often striking. Their
                stylistic pedigree is superb, for it summons images
                of the technique of Gainsborough and behind him
                Van Dyck, Rubens, and ultimately Titian. In some
                of Stuart's famous paintings of George Washington
                (which probably are dubious resemblances, since
                they were done later in life) there are to be found
                marvelous passagesofoainting.

                  John Singer Sargent was an American expatriate 
                  artist, considered the "leading portrait painter of 
                  his generation" for his evocations of Edwardian-era 
                  luxury. He created roughly 900 oil paintings and more 
                  than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches 
                  and charcoal drawings.

                  SARGENT'S artistic substance is spread
                  even thinner than Whistler's. An American cos.
                  mopolite, he travelled widely, worked anywhere
                  though chiefly in a context of high society, and
                  produced works of ingenious and channing paint
                  quality but little originality or weight. His work
                  might be thought of as a superficial popularization
                  Of Manet's sophisticated and richly artistic inno-
                  vations.

                  WINSLOW HOMER was also a
                  popular painter in that his work had its beginning in
                  illustration or in illustrative painting. Even there
                  however his style carries an integrity, a blunt facing
                  of the subject, and an objective breadth which carry
                  it beyond mere contrived illustration. Later Homer
                  became a recluse on the coast of Maine, painång
                  grand marines of waves and rocks, handsome and
                  full of a feeling of cold, desolate, and impersonal
                  nature, though if compared with similar themes by
                  Turner or Courbet, Homer's are paler in depth,
                  richness, imagination, or vital movement.

            <br>
            <p class="education-duration ">
                  Probably Homer's most effective works are wa-
                  tercolors (Plate 58a), especially those of northern
                  streams, rapids, and fishermen, where the spirit of
                  outdoor life, action, danger, and natural sport are
                  fused with a feeling for the fluid sparkle, decisive
                  movements and raw tones of nature's environment.

                  finest and strongest painters was a cool and sober
                  student of vision and anatomy. His pictures are
                  analytical and severe, but so marvelously inventive
                  and directly spontaneous as to be full of life. This is
                  far more true of the crystalline sailing and sculling
                  pictures, structured by bridges and riverbanks (Plate
                  60b), than of the portraits and medical pictures
                  which, despite fine distinction and characterization,
                  seem a little soft, less authoritative or resolved.

                  Albert Pinkham Ryder was an American painter best known for his poetic 
                  and moody allegorical works and seascapes, as well as his eccentric 
                  personality. While his art shared an emphasis on subtle variations of 
                  color with tonalist works of the time, it was unique for accentuating 
                  form in a way that some art historians regard as modernist. </p>

                  Ryder (1847-1917). For it would seem as in Eu-
                  rope that landscape counts for more with our 19th
                  century painters than other subjects. This is em-
                  phatically true of our greatest painter of that cen-
                  tury, perhaps of all American painting: ALBERT P.
                  RYDER. At first view a romantic and mystic Ryder
                  turns out to be an astonishingly solid, rich, and sober
                  painter, whose works are deeply founded on the ex-
                  perience of nature. His small panels were built up
                  painstakingly over months and years, until the forms
                  were moulded nearly into three dimensions—and
                  then he was never satisfied. He would quote Browning:
             </p>
            
            <p><strong>The little more, and how much it is;
              </strong></p>

              Marine painting is one of the strongest and most important traditions in American Art.
              After Homer and Ryder, the outstanding American sea painters are Marsden Hartley, 
              John Marin and Arthur Dove American Painting, Hartley created firm, rich expressionist 
              waves and rocks (Plate 61b). Marin chiefly in watercolor, rendered sprightly, 
              dashing whitecaps, sailboats and spray (Plate 61a). Dove (Plate 58b) was one of our most 
              inventive artists, quitely forcing through to a genuinely modern style.

                  In this art "abstract" refers generally to a form conception 
                  that refuses to present recognizable shapes, much less objects, 
                  and "Expressionism" to a freedom and spontaneity which is felt 
                  by the artist to take action from the unconscious. The work of 
                  the late ARSHILE GORKY(Plate 59b) and JACKSON POLLOCK, or of 
                  WILLEM DE KOONING, or FRANZ KLINE (Plate 64b), for example, show 
                  an expansiveness, a vigor, and freedom from reference to any other 
                  kind of art which is unexampled in European painting. Gorky 
                  represents a transition from the cosmos of Kandinsky and the 
                  fantasy of Miro. Kline at times recalls Gothic woodcut or Rembrandt's 
                  action drawings. All tend toward extensive size for a new reason: 
                  a large oil painting like the Tintoretto Loaves and Fishes in the Metropolitan 
                  Museum is meant to be taken in from some distance as part of a grand room-decoration. </p>

                  Pollock's works are typically (Plate 63b) very large not in order 
                  that we stand back as in a Baroque mural, but so that we are forced 
                  to come up close and lose ourselves in a vaster space than that which 
                  we usually inhabit. The painting forms show on the one hand the 
                  autonomy of the artist his inventive actions as he works with the 
                  paint; and on the other hand a power to suggest deep transparent planes 
                  and endless cosmic motion. But unlike a photograph of the heavens, 
                  which might show the specific appearance as light of heavenly bodies 
                  and movements, such paintings give what photography or even scientific 
                  description never could: a sense of immeasurable scale, a response to 
                  infinite motion, and an intuition of the vital creative force of the cosmos.

                  DeKooning's famous "Woman" (Plate 64a) paintings are taken thematically from 
                  unidentified denizens of Manhattan, yet by the time the images emerge on 
                  large canvas they carry a haunting primeval force, part prophetic, 
                  part demonic. If we look again (and these pictures must be seen in the original) 
                  the piling up of sunlit passages and stormy sweeps breathes like the untamed 
                  snowy peaks of the western continent.

                  Of comparable temper is the work of the sculptor, THEODORE ROSZAK, 
                  who sometimes recognizes an explicit title, like the Specter of 
                  Kitty Hawk, or states a particular purpose: the forms that I find 
                  necessary to assert are meant to be blunt reminders of primordial 
                  strife and struggle, reminiscent of those brute forces that not 
                  only produced life but in turn threatened to destroy it. I feel 
                  that, if necessary, one must be ready to summon one’s total being 
                  with an all-consuming rage against those forces that are blind to 
                  the primacy of life-giving values. Contrary to some popular 
                  suspicion (augmented by exaggerated popularizations of the life 
                  of Van Gogh), artists are seldom violent or destructive except 
                  within the forms of their art and then chiefly for the purposes 
                  of creation. Far from art being a negative sublimation of our 
                  baser nature, it is a positive and productive activity. For 
                  the artist has nerves—the source at once of pain and exaltation—in 
                  high degree. But as Tolstoy said, "art should cause violence to be 
                  set aside. And it is only art that can accomplish this."</p>

                  The art and technique of designing and building, as distinguished 
                  from the skills associated with construction. The practice of 
                  architecture is employed to fulfill both practical and expressive 
                  requirements, and thus it serves both utilitarian and aesthetic ends.
                  When we speak of art today we refer primarily to painting and sculpture. 
                  There are great architects and a great future for architecture, 
                  but it is today an engineering and designing art  deals with 
                  material and social problems. Frank Lloyd Wright was an American 
                  architect, designer, writer, and educator. He designed more 
                  than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. He is 
                  considered the “greatest American architect of all time.”

                As painters they must paint for their own edification. 
                A painter is neither a poet nor a philosopher, though 
                their ultimate ends may be comparable. Each must work 
                in his own language and vocation.An artist always stands 
                somewhere in a vital tradition even if he is in part 
                responsible for giving it life. We still belong to 
                the tradition of western art, in which the experience 
                of space is a central problem and reality.

            Architecture tends to be utilitarian and representational; sculpture is 
            figurative or representational, whereas painting is mainly concerned with 
            form and colour. Painting tends to be two-dimensional while the sculpture 
            tends to be three-dimensional. Painting tends to be made of fluid materials 
            like oil, plaster, egg, ink or water, while sculpture is made of solid 
            materials like stone, wood, clay or metal. A waterspout in a roof is in 
            origin architectural. But if it is carved on the form of animal, demon, 
            or pligrim-it may become a gargoyle. This is sculpture whether or not it 
            retains its function as a waterspout, because it's transcendent value 
            here is a decoration, expression or symbol.

            Photography of architecture can be really useful if the color 
            is good enough and if the movement of the camera is not arbitrary, 
            even 3d architectural photography cannot reproduce such important 
            experiences as orientation, scale, texture and the immanent 
            psychological sensations of volume, space, weight, mass or movement. 
            Photography of sculpture has many of the illuminations of that 
            architecture, though it has the advantage of control over the source 
            of light and the position of the spectator. The Barnes foundation in Merion, 
            Pennsylvania have masterpieces of 19th and 20th century painting but will 
            not admit to the public to see its extensive collections. The kinship 
            between sculpture and painting is perhaps more obvious. Both create images 
            and represent in such a time as ours the imaginative as opposed to the 
            utilitarian arts. Finally a sculpture and painting tends to be effective 
            arts, which architecture may but not be. Sculpture and architecture are in 
            a sense non-physical, that is they are not meant to be handled, as sculpture 
            typically is. Both are abstract in inception, and conjectural in experience. 
            A sculpture is freed or molded with the hands, and experience either by 
            the hands of the spectator or by visual processes closely related to handling.

              Sculpture is the art of removing material from a given physical mass. 
              Michelangelo, of vehemently plastic temperament, considered only the 
              first method as worthy of being called sculpture. Rodin, a more pictorial 
              artist, accepted both types in the category of being properly sculptural.

              The drill-which facilitates cutting-was in- troduced by the Greeks but found 
              its most widespread employment among Roman and Byzantine sculptors. Polishing 
              of stone is accomplished by rubbing with a series of abrasive stones, each 
              finer and finer until original receives desired sheen.

              A painting is an object. It’s object – character is often subordinate

              as an complicated structure demand the deliberate attention of the 
              artist. The structure usually consists of three parts: The support, 
              The ground and the paint layer.

                • The paint layer - Regardless of media, is composed of colored powder (pigment) and a binding agent.
              <br>
                • Water Color - The simplest binder is a water-soluble glue (gum Arabic) which is the basis of the water-color technique.

                    Tempera technique was standard for small painting in Europe well into Renaissance. 
                    The Usually ground for a tempera painting was a carefully smoothed layer of gesso 
                    (glue and white chalk) on a wooden panel. In historically, tempera painting was 
                    largely displaced by oil painting in 15th century.

                    Oil technique used as a binder a natural drying oil such as linsed oil or one various 
                    nut oils. The oil painting was pasty about like tooth paste and it “set-up” so slowly 
                    that it remained workable on the canvas for from 24 to 72 hours. Therefore, the paint 
                    could be worked in thick, pasty layer (impasto) and blended with greater variety and 
                    facility than tempera. For effect of transparency the paint could be diluted to almost 
                    any extent and applied as thin veils of color. This known as glazzing.

                We’re also widely used in conjunction with architecture. In some 
                of the earliest and finest stained glass window unmodulated sheets 
                of colored glass were cut to proper size and shape, then secured 
                in the desired pattern by lead strips. A Mosaic Is composed of 
                small pieces of colored material (tesserae) embedded in plaster to 
                secure them to the wall. The Tesserae were squared pieces of stone 
                or colored glass. The technique was, slow cumbersome and indirect 
                but the color body and the faceted surface of the Tesserae impart 
                to the wall a glistening richness that unmatched in other technique.
                In certain period social and economic condition made it desirable

                • Engraving - The line is inscribed with a burin, a steel rod of triangular cross section with a beveled points, which, when it is pushed across the plate, removes a thread-like strip of metal from the surface.
                <br>
                • Etching - The metal plate is first covered with a layer of wax. The drawing is made on this wax with a sharp point which exposes the metal. The plate is immersed in acid. The exposed lines on the Plate are attached by acid, and a pattern of depression matching drawing is produced on the plate.
                <br>
                • Dry Point - Is Produced by scratching the plate with a sharp Point. Unlike, engraving the metal is not actually removed but is displaced to one side of furrow or the other. The line really consist of two parts, the depression and this displaced curl of metal called Burr. The burr retains the ink during the wiping process and gives to the dry point line a distinctive fuzziness when it is printed.
